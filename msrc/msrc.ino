// Dummy file to open in Arduino IDE

/* arduino IDE  -- or -- eclipse.2021 with arduino support
 *  
 *  board: pro or pro-mini
 *  proc: 328p 3.3V 8MHz
 *  port: - must set -
 *
 *  attention: avoid double power supply to arduino - use special connector for serial programming/debugging
 * for upload to my arduinos must attach lipo balancer AND power (because arduino is powered via sbec of esc)
 *
 *  Changes:
 *  - millis() is uint32_t : change everything related from uint16_t to uint32_t
 *
